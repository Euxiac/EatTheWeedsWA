# EatTheWeedsWA
Concept: 
Eat the Weeds WA aims to provide a resource for people to identify and gather information on what wild growing plants (weeds) are available and edible in our local ecosystem. Most resources on weeds and wild growing plants in WA focus on either wild bush food or eradication methods for native or invasive weeds. The goal of the site is to bring the rising global movement of foraging and permaculture and simplify research and enable uptake in our own backyards.
